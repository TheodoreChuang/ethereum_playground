# Lottery Contract:

A pseudo random lottery.

Any one can enter the lottery by depositing at least the minimum amount of ETH.
The manager (owner) of the contract can instruct the contract to pseudo randomly pick a winner

TODO:

- Design the lottery to be more "fair"
  - currently everyone has an equal chance to win but deposits can vary
    - either have each entry deposit a fixed amount
    - or have weighted chance of winning based on deposit / total
